Knight Dialer is a problem given by Google in an interview to evaluate the ability to think logically, the level of proficiency in algorithms, the ability to implement ideas in a limited time (45 minutes), and evaluate algorithmic complexity given by self.

Based on the way most programmers do for the above problem is using Dynamic Programming. We analyze and then design a new solution is Dynamic Programming combines math that is optimal in terms of execution time and complexity of the problem.
